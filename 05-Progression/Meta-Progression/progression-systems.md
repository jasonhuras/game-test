# Meta Progression Systems

## Philosophy

**Goal**: Every run should contribute to long-term growth, even if you die early. Players should always have clear goals to work toward.

**Design Principles**:
1. **No Run is Wasted**: Always earn currency and progress
2. **Meaningful Unlocks**: New content changes how you play
3. **Horizontal Progression**: Variety over raw power
4. **Visible Goals**: Clear paths to desired unlocks
5. **Avoid Grind**: Fun progression, not tedious farming

## Primary Currency: Soul Essence

### How to Earn

**Sources**:
- Enemy kills: 1-5 essence per enemy (scales with enemy type)
- Wave milestones: 50 essence per wave cleared
- Boss kills: 200 essence per boss
- Achievements: 100-1000 essence per achievement
- Daily challenges: 500 essence per completion

**Retention**: 100% kept on death (no punishment for dying)

**Scaling**: Higher waves = more essence per enemy

**Example Run**:
- 10 waves cleared
- 500 enemies killed (avg 2 essence each) = 1000
- 10 waves × 50 = 500
- 2 bosses × 200 = 400
- **Total: 1900 Soul Essence**

### How to Spend

**Unlock Costs**:

| Item Type | Cost Range | Example |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| New Character | 500-2000 | Starter: 500, Advanced: 1500 |
| New Weapon | 300-1000 | Common: 300, Rare: 1000 |
| New Spell | 200-800 | Basic: 200, Advanced: 800 |
| New Augment | 100-500 | Adds to augment pool |
| Permanent Stat Boost | 1000-5000 | +5% max health (up to 20%) |
| Cosmetic | 500-2000 | Skins, emotes, sprays |

**Permanent Stat Boosts** (Optional, Controversial):

**Controversial Design Choice**: Some players love permanent progression, others hate "grinding to be viable."

**Recommendation**: Keep stat boosts small (max 20% total) and optional. Game should be beatable without them.

**Options**:
- +5% Max Health (costs 1000, max 4 purchases = +20%)
- +5% Damage (costs 1000, max 4 purchases = +20%)
- +5% Movement Speed (costs 1500, max 3 purchases = +15%)
- +1% Critical Chance (costs 800, max 5 purchases = +5%)
- +10% Experience Gain (costs 1200, max 3 purchases = +30%)

**Total Max Investment**: ~30,000 essence for all boosts (weeks of play)

## Character Unlock System

### Starting Roster
**Unlocked at Start**: 1 character (tutorial character)

**Goal**: Teach core mechanics with a balanced, easy character

### Unlock Progression

**Tier 1 Characters** (500 essence each):
- Unlocked early, expand playstyle options
- Example: Tank, DPS, Mage

**Tier 2 Characters** (1000 essence each):
- Mid-game unlocks, more specialized
- Example: Summoner, Hybrid, Support

**Tier 3 Characters** (1500-2000 essence each):
- Late-game unlocks, complex mechanics
- Example: High skill ceiling characters

### Achievement-Based Unlocks (Alternative)

**Instead of currency, unlock via feats**:
- "Reach Wave 15" → Unlock [Character]
- "Defeat Boss without taking damage" → Unlock [Character]
- "Win with 3 different characters" → Unlock [Character]

**Hybrid System**: Some characters cost essence, some require achievements

**Example**:
- Vorrath (Tank): 500 essence
- Seraph (Mage): Reach Wave 10
- Shadow (Assassin): 1000 essence + defeat Boss in under 2 minutes

---

## Weapon & Spell Unlocks

### Discovery System

**How It Works**:
1. Weapons/spells have a chance to drop during runs (1-5% per wave)
2. First time you find a weapon/spell, it unlocks permanently
3. Can then select it in future runs or find it normally

**Unlock Methods**:

#### Random Discovery
- Rare drops during runs
- Exciting when you find something new
- RNG-based (can be frustrating)

#### Essence Purchase
- Spend essence to unlock directly
- Guaranteed unlock
- More expensive than characters

#### Achievement Unlock
- "Kill 1000 enemies with melee weapons" → Unlock legendary sword
- "Cast 500 spells" → Unlock ultimate spell

**Recommended**: Hybrid (can unlock via discovery OR purchase)

---

## Account Leveling System

### Player Level

**How to Earn**: Experience from runs (separate from in-run XP)

**Progression**:
- Level 1 → 2: 1000 XP
- Level 2 → 3: 1500 XP
- Scales up to Level 100+

**Rewards Per Level**:
- 100 Soul Essence
- Every 5 levels: Unlock cosmetic item
- Every 10 levels: Unlock new augment

**Purpose**: Long-term engagement, visible progress

---

## Unlock Trees (Visual Progression)

### Tech Tree Style

**Structure**:
```
         [Character A]
              ↓
    ┌─────────┴─────────┐
[Weapon A1]         [Weapon A2]
    ↓                   ↓
[Augment A1]       [Augment A2]
```

**Example**:
- Unlock Vorrath (Tank) → Unlocks Blood Sword weapon tree
- Unlock Blood Sword → Unlocks Crimson Fury augment
- Create a sense of progression and goals

**UI**: Node-based tree, show locked/unlocked items

---

## Daily & Weekly Challenges

### Daily Challenges (Refreshes Every 24 Hours)

**Examples**:
- "Reach Wave 10 with [Specific Character]" → 500 Essence
- "Kill 200 enemies with melee weapons" → 300 Essence
- "Don't take damage for 5 waves" → 400 Essence

**Goal**: Encourage daily play, variety in playstyles

### Weekly Challenges (Refreshes Every 7 Days)

**Examples**:
- "Win 3 runs" → 1000 Essence
- "Reach Wave 20 twice" → 1500 Essence
- "Unlock a new character or weapon" → 800 Essence + cosmetic

**Goal**: Longer-term goals, higher rewards

---

## Prestige System (Post-Max Level)

### Concept

**Once max level (100)**:
- Option to "Prestige" → Reset level to 1
- Keep all unlocks (characters, weapons, spells)
- Gain prestige icon/border
- Small permanent bonus (+2% all stats per prestige, max 10 prestiges = +20%)

**Why**: Gives hardcore players infinite progression

**Controversial**: Some players hate resets. Make it optional.

---

## Battle Pass (Optional Monetization)

### Free Track
- 50 tiers
- Rewards: Essence, cosmetics, emotes

### Paid Track ($10)
- Same 50 tiers
- Better rewards: Exclusive skins, weapon skins, sprays, emotes
- **No gameplay advantages** (cosmetic only!)

### Progression
- Earn XP from matches
- Daily/weekly challenges accelerate progress
- Season duration: 3 months

**Why**: Sustainable revenue, content updates, keeps game fresh

**Important**: Never pay-to-win. Cosmetic only.

- 10+ new augments

**Essence Earned**: ~5000 total
**Essence Spent**: ~3000 (saving for later)

---

## Seasonal Content (Post-Launch)

### Seasonal Events

**Examples**:
- Halloween: Spooky biome, limited-time boss, exclusive cosmetics
- Winter: Ice biome, winter-themed skins
- Anniversary: Special challenges, free cosmetics

**Seasonal Augments**:
- Limited-time augments (return next year)
- Fun, experimental mechanics
- Not required for competitive balance

---

## Balancing Meta Progression

### Avoid Pay-to-Win
- Permanent stat boosts should be small (max 20%)
- New players can still compete
- Skill > grind

### Avoid Excessive Grind
- Unlocks should feel achievable
- ~50 hours to unlock most content
- ~100 hours for completionists

### Data-Driven Adjustments
- Track unlock rates
- If < 10% of players unlock [Item], it's too expensive or hidden
- Adjust costs based on player behavior

---

## Future Expansion Ideas

- **Relic System**: Rare items that modify runs (e.g., "Start with 3 random augments")
- **Curse Mode**: Optional hard mode with higher rewards
- **Endless Mode**: See how far you can go, special leaderboard
- **Custom Runs**: Modify rules for fun (e.g., "Only fire augments")
- **Guild/Clan System**: Team up with friends, shared progression
