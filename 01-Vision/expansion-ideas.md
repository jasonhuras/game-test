## Crazy Ideas (Maybe Too Ambitious)

## Final Thoughts

Not all ideas here will (or should) be implemented. Use this as a creative springboard. Focus on:
1. **Core experience first**: Nail the base game
2. **Quality over quantity**: 10 great characters > 50 mediocre ones
3. **Community feedback**: Listen to players
4. **Sustainable development**: Don't burn out the team

**Prioritize ruthlessly. Scope creep kills games.**
