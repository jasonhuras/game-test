# Game Vision Document

## Executive Summary

**Genre**: 3D Isometric Action Roguelike Survivor
**Target Platform**: PC (Steam), potential console ports
**Target Audience**: Core gamers who enjoy Vampire Survivors, Hades, V Rising
**Unique Selling Points**:
- Deep combat system with V Rising-style weapon mastery and spell combos
- Addictive roguelike loop with permanent meta-progression
- Strategic augment system creating infinite build variety
- Competitive ranked mode bringing PvP to the survivor genre

## Vision Statement

"Create the most satisfying and strategically deep survivor-like experience, where moment-to-moment combat feels impactful and skill-based, while offering endless replayability through roguelike progression and competitive play."

## Core Experience

### What is the game?
A 3D isometric action game where players fight increasingly difficult waves of enemies while making strategic choices about their build through augments, weapons, and spells. Each run is unique, and mastery comes from understanding synergies and executing combos.

### What makes it special?

1. **Active Combat**: Unlike traditional auto-battlers, players actively control movement and abilities
2. **Build Crafting**: Deep augment system creates meaningful choices every run
3. **Skill Expression**: Combat requires positioning, timing, and ability management
4. **Competitive Layer**: Ranked mode adds longevity and competitive depth
5. **Meta Progression**: Persistent unlocks ensure every run contributes to long-term growth

## Player Fantasy

"I'm a powerful hero wielding dark magic and legendary weapons, fighting against overwhelming odds. Each wave I defeat my power grows, and every choice I make shapes my playstyle. When I master a build, I can take it into ranked and prove I'm the ultimate survivor."

## Reference Games

| Game | What We Take |
|------|-------------|
| **V Rising** | Weapon systems, spell combos, ability feel |
| **Vampire Survivors** | Core loop, pacing, screen-filling power fantasy |
| **Mega Bonk** | Augment system, build variety, player agency |
| **Teamfight Tactics** | Augment rarity system, strategic choices |
| **Hades** | Meta progression, character unlock structure |
| **Path of Exile** | Build complexity, theorycrafting depth |

## Design Pillars

### 1. Satisfying Combat
Every attack should feel impactful. Weapons have weight, spells have visual spectacle, and enemies react meaningfully to damage.

**Success Metrics**:
- Players say combat "feels good"
- High ability usage rate (players aren't just dodging)
- Positive feedback on weapon/spell variety

### 2. Strategic Depth
No run should feel the same. Augment choices, weapon selection, and build optimization create endless variety.

**Success Metrics**:
- High build diversity in ranked modes
- Players can identify and execute synergies
- Augment pick rates are reasonably balanced

### 3. Clear Progression
Players should always feel like they're working toward something, both in-run and between runs.

**Success Metrics**:
- High session-to-session retention
- Clear understanding of unlock paths
- Satisfying power curve within runs

### 4. Competitive Integrity
Ranked mode must feel fair, skill-based, and rewarding.

**Success Metrics**:
- Players believe skill determines outcomes
- Matchmaking produces balanced games
- Ranked population is healthy

## Scope & Scale

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- 3 playable characters
- 5 weapon types
- 8 spell abilities

- 3 biomes
- 10 enemy types
- Core meta progression system
- Singleplayer mode only

### Full Launch (1.0)

## Success Criteria

### Critical Success Factors
1. Combat feels responsive and satisfying
2. Players understand the core loop within 5 minutes
3. Meta progression provides clear goals
4. Ranked mode attracts and retains competitive players
5. Build variety creates high replayability

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Day 1 retention > 40%
- Day 7 retention > 20%

- Steam rating > 4.0/5.0

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Combat doesn't feel good in 3D isometric | High | Early prototype focus, reference Hades/Diablo |
| Balancing PvE and PvP simultaneously | High | Separate balance patches, different augment pools |
| Multiplayer scope creep | Medium | Ship 1.0 without ranked, add post-launch |
| Build variety leads to balance nightmare | Medium | Data-driven balance, regular patches |
| Art production costs | Medium | Asset reuse, modular enemy design |

## Development Philosophy

1. **Prototype Fast**: Get core loop playable ASAP
2. **Iterate Based on Feel**: Combat feel trumps design docs
3. **Data-Driven Balance**: Use analytics to guide balance decisions
4. **Player-Centric**: Community feedback shapes content priorities
5. **Sustainable Scope**: Don't commit to what we can't deliver
